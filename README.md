# reverse_shell

This is a reverse shell, implemented using client-server socket programming in python.

Download the server and the client file, host the server.py on a server and note the IP.
Enter the IP in the client.py and they deploy the client.py on the targets computer.

Once connected you will see the connection status in server.py and now server can pass any command to the victim's system which executes these commands and send the output back to server....
